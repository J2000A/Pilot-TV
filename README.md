# Pilot-TV
Pilot-TV is a project from the gliding club "Segelflugclub Lauf-Lillinghof (EDQI)" where a Raspberry Pi 4 is used to display a combination of the Arrival/Departure Times from Vereinsflieger together with a view of Glidertracker. The Rasperry Pi runs all the time as it is also used as FLARM Receiver (http://wiki.glidernet.org/wiki:raspberry-pi-installation). The screen is connected via a long HDMI and only has to be turned on and off. You can store the html files either locally or on your website.
